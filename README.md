Dedupeer Project
========

The Dedupeer Project was developed by Paulo Fernando, Master candidate in Computer Science in the Federal University of Pernambuco, with Silvio Meira as advisor and Vinicius Garcia as co-advisor, aiming create a software component that could be integrated in the storage systems and benefits them with saving space, this economy of disk usage result in contributed to the green storage.


## The Algorithm

Two algorithms were developed in the Academic Master, the first is a simple algorithm that loads the whole file in the memory to be processed, and the second splits the file in segments to be loaded into memory at a time. Both were based in the rysnc algorithm.
